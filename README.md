# Attendance
The first activity consists of 2 buttons to choose from – “Warden” and “Student”.
1. On clicking the “Warden” button, a new activity is opened where the warden can give
attendance for the student. The Toast method is used to give the message if the “Save”
button is clicked after taking attendance. An array stores the names of the students
present and is passed on to the student activity page once the “SAVE” button is
clicked.
2. On clicking the “Student” button, a new activity is opened where the student can give
his roll number as input. The app checks if the given input is present in the array of
the students who are present and returns an appropriate feedback i.e. “Present” or
“Not Present”
